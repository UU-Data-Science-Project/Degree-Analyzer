    "## Background and Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "We all have heard that getting a degree provides more opportunity, a better quality of life, and a higher salary, but we also have heard how crushing student debt can be. Some students can spend their whole lives under student debt. Student debt can be a lifetime companion, and for some, it has forced many to delay their lives after university. On the flip side, getting a degree can provide freedom (financially and mentally), and a degree does lead to a higher income on average when compared to those without degrees. It appears that there are two different paths that many students might be on, and they might not be aware of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to explore this and see if we can identy what is the most optimal path to get a degree. When we say optimal we mean best income to debt ratio. We want to find (if any) variables that might lead to a better ratio. We are interested in this subject because many students attend college each year (20 million enrolled to a university in 2019, according to statista.com). We want to provide some insight and the best possible situation post-university. \n",

    "\n",
    "There is a main question we wish to answer is: Is there a way to pick a major, school, state, ect.. that will provide the best income to debt ratio. \n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, we might have to answer some other questions. \n",
    "1) How to people with degrees fair against people without? \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Does the state where you get your degree matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Do some majors/schools require a student to accumulate more debt? \n",
    "\n",
    "Answering these additional questions may allow us to answer our question more realisticallyâ€”our primary goal is to be able to answer the main question under real-life circumstances. \n",
    "\n",
    "We hope to identify some variables that are good indicators of income to debt ratio as this analysis might help future students avoid the dangers of student debt.  "
